🧸🔊 Squeaky Toy PCB

A simple **Squeaky Toy PCB** designed as a hands-on project to learn **KiCad** and understand the complete PCB design workflow — from schematic to Gerber files.

---

🎯 Project Purpose
This project was created to **learn KiCad practically** by designing a real, working circuit instead of just doing theory.  
It focuses on schematic design, PCB layout, and manufacturing-ready outputs.

⚙️ Circuit Overview
The circuit is based on a **555 Timer IC** configured to drive a buzzer, producing a squeaky sound when powered.

🔩 Main Components
- IC 555
- Resistors
- Capacitors
- Buzzer
- Battery / External power source

---
🔌 Power Specifications
- **Operating Voltage:** 3.3V – 12V  
- **PCB Type:** Single-layer PCB

---

🛠️ Tools Used
- **EDA Tool:** KiCad  
- **Design Time:** ~3 hours

---

📁 Project Contents
- 📐 Schematic (`.kicad_sch`)
- 🧩 PCB Layout (`.kicad_pcb`)
- 🏭 Gerber files (ready for manufacturing)
